This study explores the landscape of financial literacy (FL) in Italy across the years 2017, 2020, and 2023, examining its variations among different socio-demographic groups. Leveraging datasets from the Bank of Italy, the analysis employs both unsupervised and supervised analyzes through Self-Organizing Map technique in order to assess how FL is decomposed and how socio-demographic factors could influence it. The research aims to uncover insights into the role of FL in shaping economic disparities and potential socio economic divisions. Key findings highlight distinct patterns in financial attitudes, knowledge, and behaviors, emphasizing the need for targeted educational initiatives to enhance FL among diverse demographic segments. The study underscores the significance of strengthening financial literacy education as Italy prepares to integrate enhanced financial preparedness strategies.
